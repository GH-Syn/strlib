## Description
`strlib` is a Python library that provides mutative functionality for strings. It's purpose is to provide an alternative to existing libaries such as `re` through a comprehensive set of functions.
The documentation for `strlib` is generated using Sphinx.

## Rationale
This inspiration / purpose for creating this library was because in pre-refactor stage of creating `urban`, I found making a plethora of utility functoins quite difficult to navigate and document.
This library hopes to mitigate the utility overhead through modularized formatting utility functions.

## Contributions
Contributions are always welcome.
